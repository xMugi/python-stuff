cavemen - python script to take steam news rss feed and post it to an discord channel via webhook


todo?
make it so last_links wont get wiped everytime theres a new post, so it saves like last 10 links it posted, instead of only the newest, idk why but sounds nice
also mayb restructure so it uses config.json instead for better structure
